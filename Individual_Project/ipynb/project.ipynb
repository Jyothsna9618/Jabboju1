        "   - Gender equality is a core development objective in its own right. \n",
        "   - It is also smart development policy and sound business practice. It is integral to economic growth, business growth and good development outcomes. \n",
        "   - Gender equality can boost productivity, enhance prospects for the next generation, build resilience, and make institutions more representative and effective. \n",
        "   - I also wanted to look into the health sector, especially regarding female feticide which is one of the most disheartening things Iâ€™ve read in most of the articles when it comes to gender bias.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### WHY THESE INDICATORS?\n",
        "   - As i mentioned before i wanted to compare the number of infant deaths of female with male and its cause \n",
        "   - Next i wanted to compare the quality of education given to a girl child with the male child.\n",
        "   - Later, i wanted to analyze if equal rights are given to both female and male employees during retirement.\n",
        "   - I have also looked into the employment rate between men and women\n",
        "   - Lastly, i have checked the time spent by both the genders on domestic work in the household."
