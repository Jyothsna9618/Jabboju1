ACADEMIC PROJECTS
---------

- MINI PROJECT: **Secured Electronic voting machine using Biometric**; <br/>
- Description- This project was about a new proposed methodology having a highly secured process consists of mainly Aadhar, biometric and IOT. Aadhar ID is a unique card for everyone, biometric face recognition for security and IOT for the safe and immediate results. This proposed system has automatic counting of votes: highly data secured system, sending of data immediately and safe voting.
